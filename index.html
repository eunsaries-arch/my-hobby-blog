	<h1>My Favourite Hobbies</h1>

	<p>
	Hello! Welcome to my blog, and nice to meet you guys ^^
	I just want to share a few things I enjoy doing during my free time, especially when I feel upset or stressed. 
	Since I’m an introvert, I actually enjoy spending time by myself and getting lost in my own little world.
	Watching TV shows, writing, and listening to music are my favorite ways to relax and express myself

	<p>
	First of all, I spend a lot of my time watching TV shows, especially dramas. I’m a huge fan of K-dramas! I enjoy many different genres, but thriller K-dramas are definitely my favorite. 
		I love the suspense and unexpected plot twists,  they always keep me hooked. One of my all-time favorite K-dramas is Mouse, starring Lee Seung Gi. 
		Whenever someone asks for a thriller K-drama recommendation, this is always the first one I suggest. 
		If you’re looking for something exciting to watch over the weekend, feel free to check out the trailer I shared below!

	<h2 class="writing">Writing</h2>

	<p>
	Besides watching dramas, I also love writing. I’ve written a lot of poems and short stories, and some of my works have even been published by DBP.
	I’ve loved writing since I was in elementary school. Writing gives me the freedom to express my thoughts and emotions in simple but meaningful words. 
	I guess I really enjoy living in my imagination ^^.

	<h2 class="music">Listening to Music</h2>

        	Your browser does not support the audio element.
    		</audio>
	</center>

	<p>
		Lastly, I love listening to music. Music helps me calm down and clear my mind. I listen to many genres, but I enjoy K-pop and K-drama OSTs the most.
		Since I’m an ENHYPEN fan, their songs are always on my playlist. One of my favorite tracks from their album is Polaroid Love.
		Feel free to press the play button and enjoy!
